# Mindweaver HTML/CSS
**Instructor: Kim Goulbourne**

Welcome to the FEWD! This repository will contain everything you need for class.

### Lessons

In the `Lessons` folder you'll find all the slides, code and resources shared in each class. This will be uploaded by the morning of class so you'll have time to skim through before class.

- Slides: Presentation from class
- Resources: Any links or files shared during class
- Code: Starter code for in-class exerises or homework

### Communication

- During class we will be hanging out in the #mindweaver-students slack channel.
- I will send any updates or announcements via the email you have on file.
- Outside of class the best way to reach me is via email at `kimberlygoulbourne@gmail.com`. Slack is also an option but I check that less.
